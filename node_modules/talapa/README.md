Don't read this, don't use this. It's not done yet. But if you're curious, here's a very rough draft:

#Talapa Syntax
	
	html
	head
		title                           //this means the 
			Hello!                      //same as
		title - Hello!                  //this
	body
		h1 attribute='foo' - Hello

So yeah. No tags. Any indented word that's a valid tag is turned into a nested tag. A normal word or a tag with a backtick in front of it isn't changed. A dash will nest something. Anything before a dash after a tag becomes an attribute. 

Some fancy tabbing and common attribute abbreviations:
	
	div  //notice the double tab in? That is all compressed into one line.
			.class
			#id
			--prepends_data

That's valid, by the way. You don't need html or head or anything.

More than one language
	
	html   ///triple slashes are saved as <!--yourComment-->
	sass  
		body{
			a{
				blah: foo;
			}
		}
	css
		ew. why?
	
	head //yeah. Style GOES BEFORE THE HEAD. 
		//did I mention that talapa automatically sets the charset to utf-8 and uses an HTML5 doctype. You can't change that.
		coffeescript
			alert 'hey, coffescript'
		javascript
			meh
	
	body
		markdown
			#markdown 
			**Whooooo**
		escape
			this just means don't compile this part. It's a pretty dumb feature.

Talapa also has a nifty include feature. Lets say I need jQuery:
	
	html
	include jQuery2, angulARJS   //caps don't matter
	head
		//talapa just added <script src=whatever jquery is></script>, <script src=whatever angular is></script>

So Talapa has this giant directory of urls taken from cdnjs and Google Hosted Libraries, from like a month ago. It's probably out of date by now, but you can just point to the url if your library is missing, either locally or whatever you call an actual url. You can see all the urls by peeking at /lib/inclusions.js. I should make this easier, probably. 
	
	include www.google.com/jquery.js  //why isn't this the url? much simpler. 

This also makes it a lot easier to point to any stylesheets, scripts, or a favicon.
	
	include stylsheet.css, script.js, favicon.ico, jquery1

So Talapa is smart enough to parse that into valid scripts and links

Talapa also has variables. This is a stupid, useless feature.
	
	html
	vars ?turtle - SuperLongCompanyNameYouDon-tWantToTypeBecauseSeriouslyWhyWouldYouNameYourCompanyThis,, 
			?puncuationDoesn'tMatter -  see? I, can put S%-!\//whatever I want, just not two commas
	body
		?turtle ?puncuationDoesn'tMatter

Talapa also has templates.
	
	html
	def %post
		h1 - @title
		div #postWrapper
			@content
	body
		%post
			@title - avacado
			@content
				p
					once upon a time there was a very 
					nice lady named Wilfred
				p
					she liked cats. She had them everywhere.

So I define a template with def, make sure to start its name with a %, and then put talapa code in its indent. Anything I want to be user defined starts with an @. Don't use variables. When I call the template, I make a newline, type the template name, then pass values for everything I want. It's okay to not pass a value, Talapa will just keep the @valueName.

We can read templates and/or variables from other files
	
	read templates from ./templates
	read variables from ./whywouldyoudothis
	read templates and variables from ./file

Things are read procedurally. If I try to define a template twice, the last template wins.

Svg tags are not treated as tags unless in an svg block. HTML tags are not tags in an svg block.
	
	svg
		svg tags
		yeah
		no html tags

#Compiling files
Talapa is added to your path as talapa. 

Talapa can change files one at a time.
	
	talapa ./whatever.talapa ./whatever.html
	talapa ./style.sass ./style.css
	talapa ./README.md ./youCanTurnItIntoWhateverYouWant.docx
	
Talapa can compile one directory into another directory, or itself. It will preserve the file architecture. 
	
	talapa ./development ./production
	talapa ./website ./website

-xs, -xc, and -xm will prevent it from compiling sass, coffeescript, and or markdown. -p prints to the console.

we can also watch files
	
	talapa ./whatever.talapa ./whatever.html -wf
	
we can also watch directories. 
	
	talapa ./development ./production
This is fired whenever you save a file. It won't work on new files, renamed files, or new directorys.
